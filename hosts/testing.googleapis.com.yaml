                                          (5 minutes). The minimum allowed: 120 seconds
                                          (2 minutes). The shard count is dynamically
                                          set based on time, up to the maximum shard
                                          limit (described below). To guarantee at
                                          least one test case for each shard, the
                                          number of shards will not exceed the number
                                          of test cases. Shard duration will be exceeded
                                          if: - The maximum shard limit is reached
                                          and there is more calculated test time remaining
                                          to allocate into shards. - Any individual
                                          test is estimated to be longer than the
                                          targeted shard duration. Shard duration
                                          is not guaranteed because smart sharding
                                          uses test case history and default durations
                                          which may not be accurate. The rules for
                                          finding the test case timing records are:
                                          - If the service has processed a test case
                                          in the last 30 days, the record of the latest
                                          successful test case will be used. - For
                                          new test cases, the average duration of
                                          other known test cases will be used. - If
                                          there are no previous test case timing records
                                          available, the default test case duration
                                          is 15 seconds. Because the actual shard
                                          duration can exceed the targeted shard duration,
                                          we recommend that you set the targeted value
                                          at least 5 minutes less than the maximum
                                          allowed test timeout (45 minutes for physical
                                          devices and 60 minutes for virtual), or
                                          that you use the custom test timeout value
                                          that you set. This approach avoids cancelling
                                          the shard before all tests can finish. Note
                                          that there is a limit for maximum number
                                          of shards. When you select one or more physical
                                          devices, the number of shards must be <=
                                          50. When you select one or more ARM virtual
                                          devices, it must be <= 200. When you select
                                          only x86 virtual devices, it must be <=
                                          500. To guarantee at least one test case
                                          for per shard, the number of shards will
                                          not exceed the number of test cases. Each
                                          shard created counts toward daily test quota.'

                                    The shard count is dynamically set based on time,
                                    up to the maximum shard limit (described below).
                                    To guarantee at least one test case for each shard,
                                    the number of shards will not exceed the number
                                    of test cases. Shard duration will be exceeded
                                    if: - The maximum shard limit is reached and there
                                    is more calculated test time remaining to allocate
                                    into shards. - Any individual test is estimated
                                    to be longer than the targeted shard duration.
                                    Shard duration is not guaranteed because smart
                                    sharding uses test case history and default durations
                                    which may not be accurate. The rules for finding
                                    the test case timing records are: - If the service
                                    has processed a test case in the last 30 days,
                                    the record of the latest successful test case
                                    will be used. - For new test cases, the average
                                    duration of other known test cases will be used.
                                    - If there are no previous test case timing records
                                    available, the default test case duration is 15
                                    seconds. Because the actual shard duration can
                                    exceed the targeted shard duration, we recommend
                                    that you set the targeted value at least 5 minutes
                                    less than the maximum allowed test timeout (45
                                    minutes for physical devices and 60 minutes for
                                    virtual), or that you use the custom test timeout
                                    value that you set. This approach avoids cancelling
                                    the shard before all tests can finish. Note that

                                            not exceed the number of test cases. Shard
                                            duration will be exceeded if: - The maximum
                                            shard limit is reached and there is more
                                            calculated test time remaining to allocate
                                            into shards. - Any individual test is
                                            estimated to be longer than the targeted
                                            shard duration. Shard duration is not
                                            guaranteed because smart sharding uses
                                            test case history and default durations
                                            which may not be accurate. The rules for
                                            finding the test case timing records are:
                                            - If the service has processed a test
                                            case in the last 30 days, the record of
                                            the latest successful test case will be
                                            used. - For new test cases, the average
                                            duration of other known test cases will
                                            be used. - If there are no previous test
                                            case timing records available, the default
                                            test case duration is 15 seconds. Because
                                            the actual shard duration can exceed the
                                            targeted shard duration, we recommend
                                            that you set the targeted value at least
                                            5 minutes less than the maximum allowed
                                            test timeout (45 minutes for physical
                                            devices and 60 minutes for virtual), or
                                            that you use the custom test timeout value
                                            that you set. This approach avoids cancelling
                                            the shard before all tests can finish.
                                            Note that there is a limit for maximum
                                            number of shards. When you select one
                                            or more physical devices, the number of
                                            shards must be <= 50. When you select
                                            one or more ARM virtual devices, it must
                                            be <= 200. When you select only x86 virtual
                                            devices, it must be <= 500. To guarantee
                                            at least one test case for per shard,
                                            the number of shards will not exceed the
                                            number of test cases. Each shard created
                                            counts toward daily test quota.'

                                      based on time, up to the maximum shard limit
                                      (described below). To guarantee at least one
                                      test case for each shard, the number of shards
                                      will not exceed the number of test cases. Shard
                                      duration will be exceeded if: - The maximum
                                      shard limit is reached and there is more calculated
                                      test time remaining to allocate into shards.
                                      - Any individual test is estimated to be longer
                                      than the targeted shard duration. Shard duration
                                      is not guaranteed because smart sharding uses
                                      test case history and default durations which
                                      may not be accurate. The rules for finding the
                                      test case timing records are: - If the service
                                      has processed a test case in the last 30 days,
                                      the record of the latest successful test case
                                      will be used. - For new test cases, the average
                                      duration of other known test cases will be used.
                                      - If there are no previous test case timing
                                      records available, the default test case duration
                                      is 15 seconds. Because the actual shard duration
                                      can exceed the targeted shard duration, we recommend
                                      that you set the targeted value at least 5 minutes
                                      less than the maximum allowed test timeout (45
                                      minutes for physical devices and 60 minutes
                                      for virtual), or that you use the custom test
                                      timeout value that you set. This approach avoids
                                      cancelling the shard before all tests can finish.
                                      Note that there is a limit for maximum number
                                      of shards. When you select one or more physical
                                      devices, the number of shards must be <= 50.
                                      When you select one or more ARM virtual devices,
                                      it must be <= 200. When you select only x86
                                      virtual devices, it must be <= 500. To guarantee
                                      at least one test case for per shard, the number
                                      of shards will not exceed the number of test
                                      cases. Each shard created counts toward daily
                                      test quota.'

                                            not exceed the number of test cases. Shard
                                            duration will be exceeded if: - The maximum
                                            shard limit is reached and there is more
                                            calculated test time remaining to allocate
                                            into shards. - Any individual test is
                                            estimated to be longer than the targeted
                                            shard duration. Shard duration is not
                                            guaranteed because smart sharding uses
                                            test case history and default durations
                                            which may not be accurate. The rules for
                                            finding the test case timing records are:
                                            - If the service has processed a test
                                            case in the last 30 days, the record of
                                            the latest successful test case will be
                                            used. - For new test cases, the average
                                            duration of other known test cases will
                                            be used. - If there are no previous test
                                            case timing records available, the default
                                            test case duration is 15 seconds. Because
                                            the actual shard duration can exceed the
                                            targeted shard duration, we recommend
                                            that you set the targeted value at least
                                            5 minutes less than the maximum allowed
                                            test timeout (45 minutes for physical
                                            devices and 60 minutes for virtual), or
                                            that you use the custom test timeout value
                                            that you set. This approach avoids cancelling
                                            the shard before all tests can finish.
                                            Note that there is a limit for maximum
                                            number of shards. When you select one
                                            or more physical devices, the number of
                                            shards must be <= 50. When you select
                                            one or more ARM virtual devices, it must
                                            be <= 200. When you select only x86 virtual
                                            devices, it must be <= 500. To guarantee
                                            at least one test case for per shard,
                                            the number of shards will not exceed the
                                            number of test cases. Each shard created
                                            counts toward daily test quota.'

                                      minutes). The shard count is dynamically set
                                      based on time, up to the maximum shard limit
                                      (described below). To guarantee at least one
                                      test case for each shard, the number of shards
                                      will not exceed the number of test cases. Shard
                                      duration will be exceeded if: - The maximum
                                      shard limit is reached and there is more calculated
                                      test time remaining to allocate into shards.
                                      - Any individual test is estimated to be longer
                                      than the targeted shard duration. Shard duration
                                      is not guaranteed because smart sharding uses
                                      test case history and default durations which
                                      may not be accurate. The rules for finding the
                                      test case timing records are: - If the service
                                      has processed a test case in the last 30 days,
                                      the record of the latest successful test case
                                      will be used. - For new test cases, the average
                                      duration of other known test cases will be used.
                                      - If there are no previous test case timing
                                      records available, the default test case duration
                                      is 15 seconds. Because the actual shard duration
                                      can exceed the targeted shard duration, we recommend
                                      that you set the targeted value at least 5 minutes
                                      less than the maximum allowed test timeout (45
                                      minutes for physical devices and 60 minutes
                                      for virtual), or that you use the custom test
                                      timeout value that you set. This approach avoids
                                      cancelling the shard before all tests can finish.
                                      Note that there is a limit for maximum number
                                      of shards. When you select one or more physical
                                      devices, the number of shards must be <= 50.
                                      When you select one or more ARM virtual devices,
                                      it must be <= 200. When you select only x86
                                      virtual devices, it must be <= 500. To guarantee
                                      at least one test case for per shard, the number
                                      of shards will not exceed the number of test
                                      cases. Each shard created counts toward daily
                                      test quota.'

                targetedShardDuration:
                  description: 'The amount of time tests within a shard should take.
                    Default: 300 seconds (5 minutes). The minimum allowed: 120 seconds
                    (2 minutes). The shard count is dynamically set based on time,
                    up to the maximum shard limit (described below). To guarantee
                    at least one test case for each shard, the number of shards will
                    not exceed the number of test cases. Shard duration will be exceeded
                    if: - The maximum shard limit is reached and there is more calculated
                    test time remaining to allocate into shards. - Any individual
                    test is estimated to be longer than the targeted shard duration.
                    Shard duration is not guaranteed because smart sharding uses test
                    case history and default durations which may not be accurate.
                    The rules for finding the test case timing records are: - If the
                    service has processed a test case in the last 30 days, the record
                    of the latest successful test case will be used. - For new test
                    cases, the average duration of other known test cases will be
                    used. - If there are no previous test case timing records available,
                    the default test case duration is 15 seconds. Because the actual
                    shard duration can exceed the targeted shard duration, we recommend
                    that you set the targeted value at least 5 minutes less than the
                    maximum allowed test timeout (45 minutes for physical devices
                    and 60 minutes for virtual), or that you use the custom test timeout
                    value that you set. This approach avoids cancelling the shard
                    before all tests can finish. Note that there is a limit for maximum
                    number of shards. When you select one or more physical devices,
                    the number of shards must be <= 50. When you select one or more
                    ARM virtual devices, it must be <= 200. When you select only x86
                    virtual devices, it must be <= 500. To guarantee at least one
                    test case for per shard, the number of shards will not exceed
                    the number of test cases. Each shard created counts toward daily
                    test quota.'

                300 seconds (5 minutes). The minimum allowed: 120 seconds (2 minutes).
                The shard count is dynamically set based on time, up to the maximum
                shard limit (described below). To guarantee at least one test case
                for each shard, the number of shards will not exceed the number of
                test cases. Shard duration will be exceeded if: - The maximum shard
                limit is reached and there is more calculated test time remaining
                to allocate into shards. - Any individual test is estimated to be
                longer than the targeted shard duration. Shard duration is not guaranteed
                because smart sharding uses test case history and default durations
                which may not be accurate. The rules for finding the test case timing
                records are: - If the service has processed a test case in the last
                30 days, the record of the latest successful test case will be used.
                - For new test cases, the average duration of other known test cases
                will be used. - If there are no previous test case timing records
                available, the default test case duration is 15 seconds. Because the
                actual shard duration can exceed the targeted shard duration, we recommend
                that you set the targeted value at least 5 minutes less than the maximum
                allowed test timeout (45 minutes for physical devices and 60 minutes
                for virtual), or that you use the custom test timeout value that you
                set. This approach avoids cancelling the shard before all tests can
                finish. Note that there is a limit for maximum number of shards. When
                you select one or more physical devices, the number of shards must
                be <= 50. When you select one or more ARM virtual devices, it must
                be <= 200. When you select only x86 virtual devices, it must be <=
                500. To guarantee at least one test case for per shard, the number
                of shards will not exceed the number of test cases. Each shard created
                counts toward daily test quota.'

                            take. Default: 300 seconds (5 minutes). The minimum allowed:
                            120 seconds (2 minutes). The shard count is dynamically
                            set based on time, up to the maximum shard limit (described
                            below). To guarantee at least one test case for each shard,
                            the number of shards will not exceed the number of test
                            cases. Shard duration will be exceeded if: - The maximum
                            shard limit is reached and there is more calculated test
                            time remaining to allocate into shards. - Any individual
                            test is estimated to be longer than the targeted shard
                            duration. Shard duration is not guaranteed because smart
                            sharding uses test case history and default durations
                            which may not be accurate. The rules for finding the test
                            case timing records are: - If the service has processed
                            a test case in the last 30 days, the record of the latest
                            successful test case will be used. - For new test cases,
                            the average duration of other known test cases will be
                            used. - If there are no previous test case timing records
                            available, the default test case duration is 15 seconds.
                            Because the actual shard duration can exceed the targeted
                            shard duration, we recommend that you set the targeted
                            value at least 5 minutes less than the maximum allowed
                            test timeout (45 minutes for physical devices and 60 minutes
                            for virtual), or that you use the custom test timeout
                            value that you set. This approach avoids cancelling the
                            shard before all tests can finish. Note that there is
                            a limit for maximum number of shards. When you select
                            one or more physical devices, the number of shards must
                            be <= 50. When you select one or more ARM virtual devices,
                            it must be <= 200. When you select only x86 virtual devices,
                            it must be <= 500. To guarantee at least one test case
                            for per shard, the number of shards will not exceed the
                            number of test cases. Each shard created counts toward
                            daily test quota.'

                                  count is dynamically set based on time, up to the
                                  maximum shard limit (described below). To guarantee
                                  at least one test case for each shard, the number
                                  of shards will not exceed the number of test cases.
                                  Shard duration will be exceeded if: - The maximum
                                  shard limit is reached and there is more calculated
                                  test time remaining to allocate into shards. - Any
                                  individual test is estimated to be longer than the
                                  targeted shard duration. Shard duration is not guaranteed
                                  because smart sharding uses test case history and
                                  default durations which may not be accurate. The
                                  rules for finding the test case timing records are:
                                  - If the service has processed a test case in the
                                  last 30 days, the record of the latest successful
                                  test case will be used. - For new test cases, the
                                  average duration of other known test cases will
                                  be used. - If there are no previous test case timing
                                  records available, the default test case duration
                                  is 15 seconds. Because the actual shard duration
                                  can exceed the targeted shard duration, we recommend
                                  that you set the targeted value at least 5 minutes
                                  less than the maximum allowed test timeout (45 minutes
                                  for physical devices and 60 minutes for virtual),
                                  or that you use the custom test timeout value that
                                  you set. This approach avoids cancelling the shard
                                  before all tests can finish. Note that there is
                                  a limit for maximum number of shards. When you select
                                  one or more physical devices, the number of shards
                                  must be <= 50. When you select one or more ARM virtual
                                  devices, it must be <= 200. When you select only
                                  x86 virtual devices, it must be <= 500. To guarantee
                                  at least one test case for per shard, the number
                                  of shards will not exceed the number of test cases.

                            120 seconds (2 minutes). The shard count is dynamically
                            set based on time, up to the maximum shard limit (described
                            below). To guarantee at least one test case for each shard,
                            the number of shards will not exceed the number of test
                            cases. Shard duration will be exceeded if: - The maximum
                            shard limit is reached and there is more calculated test
                            time remaining to allocate into shards. - Any individual
                            test is estimated to be longer than the targeted shard
                            duration. Shard duration is not guaranteed because smart
                            sharding uses test case history and default durations
                            which may not be accurate. The rules for finding the test
                            case timing records are: - If the service has processed
                            a test case in the last 30 days, the record of the latest
                            successful test case will be used. - For new test cases,
                            the average duration of other known test cases will be
                            used. - If there are no previous test case timing records
                            available, the default test case duration is 15 seconds.
                            Because the actual shard duration can exceed the targeted
                            shard duration, we recommend that you set the targeted
                            value at least 5 minutes less than the maximum allowed
                            test timeout (45 minutes for physical devices and 60 minutes
                            for virtual), or that you use the custom test timeout
                            value that you set. This approach avoids cancelling the
                            shard before all tests can finish. Note that there is
                            a limit for maximum number of shards. When you select
                            one or more physical devices, the number of shards must
                            be <= 50. When you select one or more ARM virtual devices,
                            it must be <= 200. When you select only x86 virtual devices,
                            it must be <= 500. To guarantee at least one test case
                            for per shard, the number of shards will not exceed the
                            number of test cases. Each shard created counts toward
                            daily test quota.'

                      description: 'The amount of time tests within a shard should

                        120 seconds (2 minutes). The shard count is dynamically set
                        based on time, up to the maximum shard limit (described below).
                        To guarantee at least one test case for each shard, the number
                        of shards will not exceed the number of test cases. Shard
                        duration will be exceeded if: - The maximum shard limit is
                        reached and there is more calculated test time remaining to
                        allocate into shards. - Any individual test is estimated to
                        be longer than the targeted shard duration. Shard duration
                        is not guaranteed because smart sharding uses test case history
                        and default durations which may not be accurate. The rules
                        for finding the test case timing records are: - If the service
                        has processed a test case in the last 30 days, the record
                        of the latest successful test case will be used. - For new
                        test cases, the average duration of other known test cases
                        will be used. - If there are no previous test case timing
                        records available, the default test case duration is 15 seconds.
                        Because the actual shard duration can exceed the targeted
                        shard duration, we recommend that you set the targeted value
                        at least 5 minutes less than the maximum allowed test timeout
                        (45 minutes for physical devices and 60 minutes for virtual),
                        or that you use the custom test timeout value that you set.
                        This approach avoids cancelling the shard before all tests
