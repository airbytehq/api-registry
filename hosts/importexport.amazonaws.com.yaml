  title: AWS Import/Export
  description: <fullname>AWS Import/Export Service</fullname> AWS Import/Export accelerates
    transferring large amounts of data between the AWS cloud and portable storage
    devices that you mail to us. AWS Import/Export transfers data directly onto and
    off of your storage devices using Amazon's high-speed internal network and bypassing
    the Internet. For large data sets, AWS Import/Export is often faster than Internet
    transfer and more cost effective than upgrading your connectivity.
