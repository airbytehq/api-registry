        retrieve the next page. This method should no longer be used to retrieve subscriptions.

                      token pagination, clients should use the next/previous token
                      to get another page of the result. The presence or absence of
                      next/previous token indicates whether a next/previous page is

                                  a 50% discount for a phase of a duration of 3 months
                                  would correspond to a price of $1.50. The discount
                                  must be specified as a fraction strictly larger
                                  than 0 and strictly smaller than 1. The resulting
                                  price will be rounded to the nearest billable unit
                                  (e.g. cents for USD). The relative discount is considered
                                  invalid if the discounted price ends up being smaller
                                  than the minimum price allowed in this region.

                                        $12 for a period of 1 year, then a 50% discount
                                        for a phase of a duration of 3 months would
                                        correspond to a price of $1.50. The discount
                                        must be specified as a fraction strictly larger
                                        than 0 and strictly smaller than 1. The resulting
                                        price will be rounded to the nearest billable
                                        unit (e.g. cents for USD). The relative discount
                                        is considered invalid if the discounted price
                                        ends up being smaller than the minimum price

                            is $12 for a period of 1 year, then a 50% discount for
                            a phase of a duration of 3 months would correspond to
                            a price of $1.50. The discount must be specified as a
                            fraction strictly larger than 0 and strictly smaller than
                            1. The resulting price will be rounded to the nearest
                            billable unit (e.g. cents for USD). The relative discount
                            is considered invalid if the discounted price ends up
                            being smaller than the minimum price allowed in any new
